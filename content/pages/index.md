      - question: How long can it last powering a laptop?
        answer: >
          On average the 300W powerstation lasts 8-12 hrs with an "average
          laptop" more than enough time for most people.

          \*\*Note: \*\*An average laptop defined by us is a laptop with a 52wh
          battery and 90w adapter. To get a more accurate estimate, you can
          contact us with the model number of your laptop and how many hours the
          battery lasts currently. 


          The 500W will generally last 1.5times as much while the 2000W will
          last 7 times as much

      - question: |
          Can I return it if it shows up with defects?
        answer: >
          The product comes with a 1 year warranty and a 7day money back
          guarantee.


          This means that you can get a full cash refund if you notice a defect
          from the factory and return within 7days or use. 


          You will have to bear the cost for sending the item to us. Refund is
          processed within 5-7 working days.


          The 1 year warranty means you can get a replacement unit or free
          repair as the case may be if you notice a factory caused defect and
          report.


          You will have to bear the cost for sending the item to and from us in
          this case.
